This Repository contains software related to Siemens components used in ROS-PROFINET wrapper project:  
 
 - DK16xx PN IO - original Siemens CP1616 Linux driver + IO Base, Layer2 and Serv library
 - CP1616 GSD files for integration into Simatic NET configuration
 - STEP 7 example projects for S7-1200 PLC

#CP1616 
ROS-PROFINET wrapper project utilizes communications module CP1616 enabling SIMATIC PGs/PC and PCs equipped with a PCI slot to be connected to PROFINET IO. CP1616 offers communication possibilities of both PROFINET IO Controller and PROFINET IO Devices and with existing Linux support we consider this device an ideally suited candidate for connecting ROS-I systems to PROFINET IO.
