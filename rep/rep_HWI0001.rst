Abstract
========

Hardware interfaces are top-level priority in ROS-Industrial Roadmap, however if not considering canopen package from IPA, there hasn't been any obvious progress in this field for quite a long time now. The goal of proposed project is therefore to develop a ROS-Profinet-wrapper for Siemens CP1616 Profinet PCI card in order to make Profinet communication interface available to ROS-Industrial community.
